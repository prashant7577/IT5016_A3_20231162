# Requisition System â€“ Python Program

This program is a basic **Requisition Management System** written in Python.  
It allows a staff member to submit a requisition request, calculates the total cost of requested items, and determines if the request is approved based on a set limit.

## How It Works

### 1. Staff Info Input
- User is asked to enter the **date**, **staff ID**, and **staff name**.
- Requisition ID starts at `10000` and increases by 1.

### 2. Requisition Items
- User inputs the number of items.
- For each item:
  - Enter the **name** and **price**.
- The system calculates and displays the **total cost**.

### 3. Approval Check
- If total is **below $500**:
  - Status becomes **"Approved"**.
  - An **approval reference number** is created using staff ID and requisition ID.
- If total is **$500 or more**:
  - Status remains **"Pending"**.
  - No reference number is generated.

### 4. Display Section
- Final requisition details are printed, including:
  - Date
  - Requisition ID
  - Staff ID
  - Staff Name
  - Total
  - Status
  - Approval Reference Number (if applicable)
